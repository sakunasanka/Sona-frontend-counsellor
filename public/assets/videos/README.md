# Video Background Setup

To complete the video background setup for the features section, you'll need to add a video file.

## Video Requirements

**File Path:** `/public/assets/videos/healthcare-background.mp4`

**Recommended Video Specifications:**
- **Duration:** 30-60 seconds (will loop automatically)
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080 (Full HD) minimum
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 
- **File Size:** Under 10MB for optimal loading
- **Format:** MP4 (H.264 codec)
- **Frame Rate:** 30fps
- **Content:** Healthcare/medical related, professional, calming

## Video Content Suggestions

1. **Medical professionals in consultation**
2. **Modern healthcare technology interfaces**
3. **Calming abstract medical animations**
4. **Healthcare facilities or equipment**
5. **Data visualization or analytics themes**

## Where to Find Healthcare Videos

**Free Options:**
- Pixabay (pixabay.com/videos/)
- Pexels (pexels.com/videos/)
- Unsplash (unsplash.com - has some video content)

**Premium Options:**
- Shutterstock
- Getty Images
- Adobe Stock

## Search Keywords

- "healthcare technology"
- "medical consultation"
- "hospital modern"
- "healthcare analytics"
- "medical data"
- "telemedicine"
- "digital health"

## Current Fallback

Currently, the video element has a poster image (`hero-dashboard-preview.webp`) that will show if the video fails to load. The section will still look great even without the video file.

## Implementation Notes

- The video is set to autoplay, muted, and loop
- There's a gradient overlay to ensure text readability
- The video is optimized for all device sizes
- Fallback styling is in place for browsers that don't support video backgrounds
